# Recyclable_System
The goal of this project was to design a cohesive system that had the ability to accurately sort and recycle containers of varying materials. This was achieved by designing a mechanism in Autodesk Inventor and programming a robotic arm and vehicle in Quanser Labs using Python 3, all aiding in sorting and transporting containers to specific bins.
